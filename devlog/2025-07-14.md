# July 14, 2025: Creation of the main menu

Decided to revamp a bit from scratch and start the modular formating now. This allows for us to have a menu which
completely makes this a lot more controllable. Now I can do each bit in sections and I can exit freely now!! :D

# Things to work on next
- Will probably start with the Employee Info header file first. This will be for option 3 of the menu, but will hold the struct and all necessary info.
