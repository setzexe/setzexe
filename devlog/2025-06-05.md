# June 6, 2025: Troubleshooting notes + Hiatus

Unfortunately got caught up with a lot of work and responsibility (and 40% laziness -__-) I plan to get this to a good point in the
future and release this. This page just exists to point out some issues I will troubleshoot before continuing. 

# Things to troubleshoot
- Does not exit. No way of showing the vector results
- Very cluttered (Need to fix my personal VSC Ui and make header files)
