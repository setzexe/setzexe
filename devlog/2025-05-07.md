# May 7, 2025 -- First Progress on Mini-Project (Employee Information & Clock-In system)

To get used to this entire github and vscode thingy, I decided to make a little project based on employee information & clock in system,
one that you would see at a casual workplace. Hopefully something I get to show to my current manager and he is impressed by ^^

# Progress so far:
- Created a structure that stores employee names (string) and pins (int)
- Create a system that requires input confirms name and pin (by inputting it again through another set of variables)
- Display the information through a vector of the inputted (and confirmed) information

# Problems / Things to improve upon
- When I Bash it, it only allows me one test so far
- You can put more than 4 numbers as the pin, and it accepts letters too
- Would like to start on the actual clock in system after this
